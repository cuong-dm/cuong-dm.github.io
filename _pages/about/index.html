I’m Cuong, but you can call me Marcus. I’m currently a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">National University of Singapore</a>, where I have the privilege of working under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</a>. Prior to joining NUS, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://soict.hust.edu.vn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)</a>, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://ai4life.hust.edu.vn/lenp/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Phi Le Nguyen</a> and Professor <a href="https://htnghia87.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Trong Nghia Hoang</a>.</p> <p><strong><em>I’m currently seeking PhD opportunities in Computer Science for the upcoming academic year.</em></strong></p> </body></html>
