Hi! I'm Cuong, but you can call me Marcus.

I'm currently a Research Assistant in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), where I have the privilege of working under the supervision of Professor [Bryan Kian Hsiang Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/). Prior to joining NUS, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Phi Le Nguyen](https://ai4life.hust.edu.vn/lenp/) and Professor [Trong Nghia Hoang](https://htnghia87.github.io/).

My previous research primarily focused on tackling the [Offline Black-box Optimization problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08450), where I proposed methods for regularizing surrogate losses [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04181)], [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04242)], and incorporating techniques from diffusion models. Currently, my interests have shifted toward data attribution, data valuation, and data-centric AI, with a particular emphasis on data selection for pretraining large language models (LLMs). Beyond these areas, I remain curious and eager to explore a wide range of research topics.

***I'm currently seeking PhD opportunities in Computer Science for the upcoming academic year.***
